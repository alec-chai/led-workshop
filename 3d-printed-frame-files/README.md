# 3D Printed Frame

This folder contains five STL files that are necessary for creation of the earlier 3D-printed prototype of the picture frame. 

If you 3D-print this frame, you will need to turn on support generation and reorient the components so that the flat edge faces of the frame are adhered to the bed.
