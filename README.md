# LED Workshop

This github repository was created on October 3, 2022 for the CEID LED programming workshop.

The "example code" folder has code that we will go through during the workshop. Other folders contain the laser cut files necessary for reproducing the frame that we assembled.

There is also a folder containing STL files to reproduce an earlier 3d-printed prototype of the acrylic picture frame.

Feel free to email me at alec.chai@yale.edu with any questions!
