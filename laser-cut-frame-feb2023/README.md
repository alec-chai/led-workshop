# LED Workshop

This github repository was created on October 3, 2022 for the CEID LED programming workshop.

The "example code" folder has code that we will go through during the workshop. Other folders contain the laser cut files necessary for reproducing the frame that we assembled.

The design is created to house two acrylic disks 4.5-inches in diameter with LEDs lining the outside. The two outside portions of the frame (the front and back) may be cut out of any thickness of material, however the middle layer must be cut out of 1/2-inch wood so that it can house the disks and the LEDs.

I used approximately 14 inches of WS2812 addressable LEDs along with an Arduino Nano and 3-ft USB -> mini USB cable.
