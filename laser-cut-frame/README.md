# Laser-cut Frame

This contains 3 DXF files that are needed to create the "sandwich" that holds your acrylic picture. 

Your picture will need to take the form of an acrylic circle that is exactly 4.5 inches in diameter and a half-inch thick. I created the pictures by rastering an image onto one 1/4" circle and printing a second blank 1/4" inch circle and combining the two to create a half-inch picture.

There is a DXF file for the top, middle, and bottom layers. The middle portion *needs* to be cut out of 1/2" wood so that the outside of the circle can be lined with the addressable LEDs. The top and bottom layers can be a thickness of your choosing.
